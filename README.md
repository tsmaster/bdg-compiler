This is the Big Dice Games Compiler Project of 2014-2015.

There is a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/tsmaster/bdg-compiler).

There is also a [private BitBucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/tsmaster/bdgrt/wiki/Home), which is useful for my (Dave's) own project planning.

The Ply directory is where anything interesting is.
